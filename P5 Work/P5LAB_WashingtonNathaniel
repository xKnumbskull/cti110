# P5LAB: Self-Checkout Machine
# This program simulates a self-checkout machine where the customer enters the amount of cash to pay for a random purchase. 
# It calculates the change and breaks it down into dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

import random

def main():
    # Generate a random purchase amount (owed amount)
    owed_amount = round(random.uniform(0.01, 100.00), 2)

    # Display the owed amount
    print(f"Total amount owed: ${owed_amount:.2f}")

    # Prompt user for the amount of cash they will pay
    cash_paid = float(input("Enter the amount of cash you will pay: $"))

    # Calculate change owed
    if cash_paid < owed_amount:
        print("Insufficient cash. Please enter a valid amount.")
        return

    change_owed = cash_paid - owed_amount
    print(f"Change owed: ${change_owed:.2f}")

    # Convert change to cents
    total_cents = int(round(change_owed * 100))

    # Coins in currency (dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies)
    coin_values = [100, 25, 10, 5, 1]

    # Loop through each coin type
    for value, name in zip(coin_values, coin_names):
        count = total_cents // value
        total_cents %= value
